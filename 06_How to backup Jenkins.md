# How to backup Jenkins

Backing up Jenkins is a critical task to ensure that you can restore the system in case of any failures or data corruption. Jenkins stores its configuration, jobs, plugins, and build history in the Jenkins home directory, and backing it up ensures that you don't lose any important data.

There are multiple ways to back up Jenkins, and I will explain the most common ones in detail below:

### 1. **Manual Backup of Jenkins Home Directory**

This is the most straightforward method of backing up Jenkins. The Jenkins home directory (`$JENKINS_HOME`) contains all the configuration files, job details, build histories, and plugins. You can take a manual backup of this directory.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Locate the Jenkins Home Directory:**
   - On Linux: By default, it's located at `/var/lib/jenkins/`.
   - On Windows: By default, it's in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins`.
   - You can also check the value of `$JENKINS_HOME` in the system configuration.

2. **Stop Jenkins Service:**
   - It's a good idea to stop Jenkins before backing up, to ensure that no data is being written during the process.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop jenkins  # On Linux
   net stop jenkins  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Copy Jenkins Home Directory:**
   - You can use tools like `rsync` or `cp` on Linux or a simple file copy on Windows to back up the entire directory.
   ```bash
   sudo cp -r /var/lib/jenkins /backup-location/jenkins-backup/
   ```

4. **Start Jenkins Service:**
   - After the backup is complete, restart the Jenkins service.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start jenkins  # On Linux
   net start jenkins  # On Windows
   ```

#### **Pros:**
- Simple and reliable.
- Easy to restore by copying back the backed-up files.

#### **Cons:**
- Manual process, prone to human error if not done regularly.
- Jenkins needs to be stopped during the backup, which could cause downtime.

### 2. **Automated Backup with Jenkins Plugins**

Jenkins has several plugins that allow you to automate the backup process without stopping Jenkins. One such plugin is the **ThinBackup Plugin**.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Install the ThinBackup Plugin:**
   - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`.
   - Search for `ThinBackup` and install it.
   
2. **Configure ThinBackup:**
   - After installing, go to `Manage Jenkins` > `ThinBackup Settings`.
   - Set up the backup directory (where the backups will be stored).
   - Configure the backup schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Specify whether you want to back up jobs, build records, and other components.
   
3. **Take Manual or Automated Backup:**
   - To take a manual backup, click `Backup Now` under the ThinBackup settings.
   - For automated backups, configure a schedule, and the plugin will automatically back up Jenkins as per the defined intervals.

4. **Restoring from ThinBackup:**
   - To restore, go to `ThinBackup Settings` > `Restore`, and select the backup archive you wish to restore.

#### **Pros:**
- No downtime; Jenkins keeps running during the backup.
- Automated backups with scheduling support.

#### **Cons:**
- Requires installing and configuring an additional plugin.
- Does not handle build artifacts by default (only configuration and job history).

### 3. **Backup with File System Snapshots (e.g., LVM or AWS Snapshots)**

If you're running Jenkins on a server with a modern file system or cloud-based storage (like AWS EBS), you can use snapshots to create point-in-time backups.

#### **Steps for AWS EBS Snapshots (for example):**

1. **Ensure Jenkins Data Is on an EBS Volume:**
   - The Jenkins home directory (`$JENKINS_HOME`) should be stored on an EBS volume.

2. **Create EBS Snapshot via AWS Management Console or CLI:**
   - In the AWS console, go to the EC2 dashboard, find the EBS volume where Jenkins data is stored, and create a snapshot.
   ```bash
   aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-1234567890abcdef0 --description "Jenkins backup snapshot"
   ```

3. **Automate Snapshots with AWS Lambda or a Backup Service:**
   - You can use AWS Lambda or a third-party service to schedule regular EBS snapshots.

4. **Restore from Snapshot:**
   - If needed, you can restore by creating a new volume from the snapshot and attaching it to your Jenkins server.

#### **Pros:**
- Fast and reliable.
- No downtime required.
- Captures the entire file system state.

#### **Cons:**
- Can be costly depending on the storage and snapshot frequency.
- Restoration might require detaching and reattaching storage volumes.

### 4. **Backing Up Jenkins Configuration with Job Configuration History Plugin**

The **Job Configuration History Plugin** allows you to track and back up the history of changes made to Jenkins jobs and system configurations.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Install Job Configuration History Plugin:**
   - Go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`.
   - Search for `Job Configuration History Plugin` and install it.

2. **Configure the Plugin:**
   - After installation, go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System`.
   - Under the `Job Configuration History` section, configure the number of backups to retain and other settings.

3. **View or Restore Configurations:**
   - The plugin automatically backs up configuration changes. You can view or restore job configurations from the plugin interface under `Job Configuration History`.

#### **Pros:**
- Useful for tracking and restoring changes to job and system configurations.
- Jenkins continues running during the backup process.

#### **Cons:**
- Only backs up configuration and job history, not build history or build artifacts.
- Restoration of full Jenkins environment not possible.

### 5. **Backing Up Using Jenkins in a Docker Container**

If you're running Jenkins in a Docker container, you can back up the persistent volumes associated with Jenkins.

#### **Steps:**

1. **Stop the Jenkins Container:**
   - Ensure that Jenkins is not writing data while you're backing it up.
   ```bash
   docker stop jenkins
   ```

2. **Backup Jenkins Data Volume:**
   - Use `docker cp` to copy data from the Jenkins container or backup the entire volume.
   ```bash
   docker cp jenkins:/var/jenkins_home /backup-location/jenkins-backup/
   ```

3. **Restart the Jenkins Container:**
   ```bash
   docker start jenkins
   ```

#### **Pros:**
- Works well in Docker-based Jenkins environments.
- Can be scripted and automated with Docker or other container orchestration tools.

#### **Cons:**
- Requires Docker knowledge.
- Backup is only as reliable as the persistent storage attached to the container.
