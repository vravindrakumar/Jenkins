# What is the Use of Jenkins?

### Jenkins is primarily used to:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Jenkins automates the integration of code from multiple developers, ensuring that new code is tested and merged frequently into the main codebase.
   
2. **Continuous Delivery (CD):** It automates the release process, allowing for code to be automatically deployed to staging and production environments after passing automated tests.
   
3. **Automated Builds and Testing:** Jenkins automatically triggers builds and runs unit tests, integration tests, and other types of testing after each commit, ensuring that any issues are identified early.

4. **Orchestration of the Entire CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkins integrates various DevOps tools (like Git for version control, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for deployment, etc.) to orchestrate the complete CI/CD pipeline.
