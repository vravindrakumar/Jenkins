# What is Jenkins?

**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server used to automate the tasks of building, testing, and deploying software in the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) process. It is widely used for managing and automating repetitive tasks in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Jenkins allows developers to continuously integrate their code into a shared repository and continuously deliver their application to production environments.

**Key Features of Jenkins:**
- **Open Source:** Free to use and has a large community for support.
- **Extensible:** With more than 1800 plugins, Jenkins can integrate with almost any tool in the DevOps toolchain (e.g., Git, Maven, Docker, Kubernetes).
- **Distributed Builds:** Jenkins can distribute work across multiple machines for faster and more efficient builds.
- **Automated Testing:** Jenkins can trigger tests automatically upon every code change, helping catch bugs early.
- **Customizable:** Users can create their own pipelines using declarative or scripted pipeline formats.
