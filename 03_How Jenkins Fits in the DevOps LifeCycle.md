# How Jenkins Fits in the DevOps LifeCycle

### DevOps Lifecycle:
1. **Plan** → 2. **Code** → 3. **Build** → 4. **Test** → 5. **Release** → 6. **Deploy** → 7. **Operate** → 8. **Monitor**

Jenkins plays a central role in multiple stages of the DevOps lifecycle:

- **Code:** Developers push their code to version control systems like GitHub. Jenkins can automatically detect these changes (via webhooks) and pull the updated code.
  
- **Build:** Jenkins integrates with build tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle) to compile the code and build artifacts (e.g., WAR/JAR files).
  
- **Test:** Automated testing (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) is triggered by Jenkins to validate the quality of the code.
  
- **Release & Deploy:** After successful tests, Jenkins can trigger the deployment of applications to various environments like staging or production, using tools like Ansible, Docker, or Kubernetes.
  
- **Monitor:** Jenkins can integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track the health and performance of deployed applications and trigger alerts if necessary.
